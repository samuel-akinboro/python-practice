# Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

# slicing from the start
# By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character

# slice to the end
# By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end

# Negative Indexing
# Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string
